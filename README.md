The purpose of this site is to buy and sell virtual games. You could also preview and pre-order upcoming games.

## Description

We were tasked with coding our fully designed website from a former project. We also had to make everything function with Wordpress so that adding new products through wordpress would automatically appear.

The site's foundation coding-wise is not the most ideal due to it was made when I was less experienced. It could have been much different if I worked on this project again.
